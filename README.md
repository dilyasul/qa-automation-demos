#  QA Automation Demos

This repository contains a collection of QA automation test suites built to simulate real-world testing scenarios across web-based applications. Each project focuses on a specific domain (e.g., cybersecurity, form validation, UI behavior) and demonstrates how automated testing can be used to validate functionality, improve reliability, and prevent regressions.

##  Why QA Automation?

Quality Assurance (QA) testing plays a critical role in the development lifecycle by ensuring that applications work as intended before they reach users. Automation takes this a step further by:

-  **Accelerating test execution** across large codebases and environments  
-  **Catching bugs early** before they reach production  
-  **Ensuring consistency** in repetitive tasks  
-  **Freeing up time** for deeper exploratory/manual testing  
-  **Improving overall security and stability** of web apps

As more businesses depend on software, robust QA processes become essential not just for functionality — but also for user trust, security, and performance.

## 🗂 Projects in This Repository

Each folder in this repository represents a self-contained automation project, written using modern tools like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), designed to simulate real QA work.

###  `xss-playground-tests/`
Automated Playwright test suite for a simulated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack demonstration app.

- Validates proper blocking, sanitization, and execution of XSS payloads under various modes (`safe`, `purify`, `vulnerable`)
-  Tests UI reset behavior and dynamic rendering
-  Includes clipboard and form behavior checks

>  Pairs with: [cybersecurity-demos/xss-playground](https://github.com/yourusername/cybersecurity-demos/tree/main/xss-playground)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)** — End-to-end testing framework
- **Node.js** — JavaScript runtime
- **Git** — Version control
- *(Optional: add others like Mocha, Chai, Jest, etc. as you expand)*

## 🚧 Future Plans

- Add automated tests for:
  - Credential Stuffing demo
  - Phishing URL Lookalike demo
  - Password Strength Checker
- Integrate GitHub Actions for CI/CD test automation
- Add cross-browser and device emulation testing
- Expand test coverage to accessibility and performance
