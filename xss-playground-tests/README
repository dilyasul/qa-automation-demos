xss-playground-tests
Automated end-to-end tests for the XSS Playground project using Playwright.

This test suite validates both the functional behavior and security handling of a simulated XSS-vulnerable web application. It checks whether malicious scripts are blocked, sanitized, or executed under different modes â€” demonstrating real-world Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) scenarios and best practices.

** What it Tests **

-XSS Sanitization	Checks that dangerous input is sanitized in Purify mode
-XSS Execution	Confirms payloads execute in Vulnerable mode (with alert counter)
-Reset Button	Clears input, comments, and resets alert counter
